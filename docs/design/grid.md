We use an 8-point grid system, where instead of 8-points equalling eight pixels, it equals one unit.

## Unit

The unit is used to calculate sizes for all of the UI (until we introduce a separate relative size grid and layout system based on the viewport size).

### Responsive unit

| Viewport width                 | Size |
|--------------------------------|------|
| `< 600`                        | 6px  |
| Between `>= 600` and `<= 1920` | 8px  |
| `> 1920`                       | 10px |
