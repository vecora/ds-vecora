## Grid

Using flexbox. [Read tutorial at CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

### Max widths

Helper classes to provide wider containers than the grid system allows, but still limit the max width. To accomplish this, use `container-fluid` together with these classes:

| Class            | Width  |
| ---------------- |--------|
| `max-width-hd`   | 1920px |
| `max-width-2k`   | 2048px |
| `max-width-wqhd` | 2560px |  
| `max-width-uhd`  | 3840px |
| `max-width-4k`   | 4096px |
