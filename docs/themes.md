# Themes

| Theme     | Class              |
| --------- |--------------------|
| Default   | No class required. |
| Dark      | `theme-dark`       |  
| Corporate | `theme-corporate`  |
| Sales     | `theme-sales`      |

Theme classes can be applied any box, and applies to everything inside that box, but not the box itself. To apply the theme to a whole page it must be applied to the `html` element, like so:

```html
<html lang="en" class="theme-dark">
```
