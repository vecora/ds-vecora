## Build instructions

### Building the style guide

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), if it's not already installed.

2. Open Terminal in the folder where the repository is located.

3. Install [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) globally, if it's not already installed, by typing `sudo npm install -g gulp`.

4. Install dependencies locally by typing `npm install --save-dev`.

5. Type `gulp` to build. Build files are located in the `dist` folder. Alternatively type `gulp watch` to watch for changes in the `src` folder and build continuously as files are changed.
